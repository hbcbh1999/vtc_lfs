##### Video Traffic Counter
---

VTC is a video-based traffic counting application for Windows computers. VTC targets Windows 10 but should also work on Windows 7, Vista and 8.

VTC does not have any strict hardware dependencies, but a modern nVidia discrete GPU is highly recommended. GTX1060 has been tested; at least 4GB of RAM in the GPU is recommended. The GPU *must* be nVidia-brand in order to yield a performance improvement; VTC requires CUDA to accelerate image-recognition tasks.

### Development environment setup

 * Install Visual Studio 2017 to build VTC.
 * Clone repository anywhere (e.x. - `C:\VTC`).
 * Optional: install Visual Studio 2015 to build Yolo DLL.
 * Optional: install Emgu/OpenCV.

### Image debugger visualizer
During debugging it's useful to view image objects as a raster image, not as a array or bytes. To install image visualizer follow instructions at `\Thirdparty\ImageVisualizer\readme.txt`.

### Visualizing unit tests
Use `-tests` command line argument to run unit tests.

### Logs
Logs are written to `%AppData%\VTC\1.0\Logs\`.
